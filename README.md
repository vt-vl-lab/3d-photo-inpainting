We propose a method for converting a single RGB-D input image into a 3D photo, i.e., a multi-layer representation for novel view synthesis that contains hallucinated color and depth structures in regions occluded in the original view. We use a Layered Depth Image with explicit pixel connectivity as underlying representation, and present a learning-based inpainting model that iteratively synthesizes new local color-and-depth content into the occluded region in a spatial context-aware manner. The resulting 3D photos can be efficiently rendered with motion parallax using standard graphics engines. We validate the effectiveness of our method on a wide range of challenging everyday scenes and show fewer artifacts when compared with the state-of-the-arts.

## Update
- This branch includes a `environment.yml` file to help with repo installation on Windows 10 
- [Cuda Support](https://github.com/vt-vl-lab/3d-photo-inpainting/pull/30)
- no need to specify file type - `.png` and `.jpg` will work automagicly
- [MiDaS](https://github.com/intel-isl/MiDaS/releases/tag/v1) upgraded to [MiDaS v2](https://github.com/intel-isl/MiDaS/releases/tag/v2)


## Prerequisites

- Linux (tested on Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS) or Windows 10
- Anaconda
- Python 3.7 (tested on 3.7.4)
- PyTorch 1.4.0 (tested on 1.4.0 for execution)

and the Python dependencies listed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)
- To get started, please run the following commands:
**Linux**
    ```bash
    conda create -n 3DP python=3.7 anaconda
    conda activate 3DP
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    conda install pytorch==1.4.0 torchvision==0.5.0 cudatoolkit==10.1.243 -c pytorch
    ```
    **Windows 10**
    ```bash
   conda env create --file environment.yml
    ```
- Next, please download the model weight using the following command:
    ```bash
    chmod +x download.sh
    ./download.sh
    ```    

## Quick start
Please follow the instructions in this section. 
This should allow to execute our results.
For more detailed instructions, please refer to [`DOCUMENTATION.md`](DOCUMENTATION.md).

## Execute
1. Put ```.jpg or .png``` files (e.g., test.jpg) into the ```image``` folder. 
    - E.g., `image/moon.jpg`
2. Run the following command
    ```bash
    python main.py --config argument.yml
    ```
    - Note: The 3D photo generation process usually takes about 2-3 minutes depending on the available computing resources.
3. The results are stored in the following directories:
    - Corresponding depth map estimated by [MiDaS](https://github.com/intel-isl/MiDaS.git) 
        - E.g. ```depth/moon.npy```, ```depth/moon.png```
        - User could edit ```depth/moon.png``` manually. 
            - Remember to set the following two flags as listed below if user wants to use manually edited ```depth/moon.png``` as input for 3D Photo.
                - `depth_format: '.png'`
                - `require_midas: False`
    - Inpainted 3D mesh (Optional: User need to switch on the flag `save_ply`)
        - E.g. ```mesh/moon.ply```
    - Rendered videos with zoom-in motion
        - E.g. ```video/moon_zoom-in.mp4```
    - Rendered videos with swing motion
        - E.g. ```video/moon_swing.mp4```
    - Rendered videos with circle motion
        - E.g. ```video/moon_circle.mp4```         
    - Rendered videos with dolly zoom-in effect
        - E.g. ```video/moon_dolly-zoom-in.mp4```
        - Note: We assume that the object of focus is located at the center of the image.
4. (Optional) If you want to change the default configuration. Please read [`DOCUMENTATION.md`](DOCUMENTATION.md) and modified ```argument.yml```.
